# BubbleTrouble
The project is a Bubble Trouble Game, where the objective is to navigate a character through a series of levels by popping bubbles that bounce around the screen.  Java StdDraw Library is used for animation 
Players must dodge the bubbles and shoot harpoons to split and ultimately destroy them, with each level presenting increasing challenges and more complex bubble patterns.
The game tests players' reflexes and strategic planning as they aim to clear all bubbles without being hit.
