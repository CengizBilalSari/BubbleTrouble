/**
 * This main is designed based on environment class.
 * Firstly the code puts environment constructor, and it sets the canvas.
 * The main while loop includes bubble Trouble Game method of environment class.
 * If this method ends, the code controls whether player wins the game or not.
 * In these conditions, if player wants to quit the game, system exits. If player wants to replay the game,
 * the game starts again.
